# LelahDoesTech - Google with a Twist

Hello, World! This is my Google Clone - with a twist - 
By the name you can tell that this code is a clone of the google landing page, but with a few edits 
1) All of the links work- with the exception of the setting
2) The "I'm feeling lucky" button - since this button does not work on Google's landing page, I decided to have some fun and instead link it to a lottery site. This reflects the same theme that Google has with links to different "I" statements.
3) On the Menu tab, I added links to all my socials - Linkedin, GitHub, and Youtube. Where others can view my journey.

Languages Used:

HTML5 , CSS , Javascript

Thank you for reading, :)! 

See you <3
